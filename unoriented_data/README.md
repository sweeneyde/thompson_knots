In these files, elements of Thompson's group F
(pairs of trees represented by Dyck words)
are partitioned by the HOMFLYPT polynomial of the link that they produce.

Since HOMFLYPT polynomials are a property of oriented links
and Thompson's group does not in general offer a canonical orientation,
orientations have been assigned arbitrarily.
Hence, there are multiple polynomials per unoriented link,
and there might not be the same number of tree pairs in each polynomial component.

`unoriented6_labelled.txt` and `unoriented7.txt` have each polynomial component labelled with the name of the corresponding link. I added these labels by hand, so it's possible there are mistakes.
